name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
# For branch protection rules, you can also use the "push" event but with the "branches"
# or "tags" filters to specify which branches or tags should trigger the workflow.
# For example, only trigger on push to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
# For more information, see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

jobs:
  # This job builds the extension and runs linters/tests.
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository into the current runner environment
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Set up Node.js environment. This uses the Node.js 20.x version. 
      # Consider updating to the latest LTS or the version specified in your project's .nvmrc or package.json.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Install dependencies using npm
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Run linters and formatters. Assuming Biome is configured and the run command is `biome check --apply` for apply, or `biome ci` for checking.
      # If you use Ruff for JS/TS, adjust accordingly. The prompt implies a JS project, so npm/Biome is most likely.
      - name: Lint and Format Check
        run: npm run lint # Assuming 'lint' script runs Biome check

      # Run tests using Vitest. Assuming 'test' script runs Vitest.
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm test # Assuming 'test' script runs Vitest

      # Optional: If Playwright is used for E2E tests, add a step for it.
      # - name: Run E2E Tests
      #   run: npm run test:e2e # Assuming 'test:e2e' script runs Playwright

      # Optional: Build the extension artifact.
      # This assumes a build script exists, e.g., `npm run build` which outputs to a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
      # The exact command might depend on your Vite configuration for Chrome Extensions.
      - name: Build Extension
        run: npm run build # Assuming 'build' script creates extension files

      # Optional: Upload build artifacts for later use (e.g., release or deployment).
      # Adjust 'path' to your build output directory.
      - name: Upload Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: chrome-extension-build
          path: dist # Or 'build', or wherever your build output is located
